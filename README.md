# Defense Against the Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning

This repository contains codes and scripts belonging to the CSE6801 (Distributed Computing Systems) project. In this project, we attempted to detect and mitigate the effect of backdoor attacks in federated machine learning. We used [**Flower**](https://github.com/adap/flower) framework to implement the federated learning system.

## Guidelines

- Create a *virtual environment* or *Conda environment* and `pip install` Flower (`flwr`), PyTorch (`torch`), and TorchVision (`torchvision`).
- For running the project, follow the instructions provided in [**this tutorial**](https://flower.dev/docs/framework/tutorial-quickstart-pytorch.html) with the scripts uploaded to this repository.
